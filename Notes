Containers:
vector : array (most used)
queue 
stack
priority_queue : heap
list : linked list
set : tree (balanced bst)
map : associative array

Array(static): linear collection of similar elements
pair is a template class in STL, not a part of container

Vector(dynamic):doesn't resize on every step. doubles in size when filled and one more inserted.

List: bidirectional linear list sequentially accessible front to back or back to front

Map: Associative array (regular one is called numeric array because indices are numeric) contains sorted key-value pair, in which each key is unique(can be inserted,deleted but cannot be altered.)  

Map[key] = value

keys are kept in sorted order

Set: same as map except that it stores only the key. hence, no duplicates. implemented as a Balanced BST (RB tree), all operations have O(log n) complexity. elements sorted in ascending order.

PYTHON Notes
--type(var) gives data type of var
str() used to switch between data type
str is string data type "vivek" or 'vivek'
bool is boolean data type .. True or False
list is also a data type. l=[a,b,c]
any type of a,b,c (even lists)... also different types of a,b,c
[['a',1],['b',2],['c',3]]
type(l) gives list
'a'*5 gives 'aaaaa' as output
** is the exponentiation operator ... preferred over others
'aa'**3 = 'aaaaaaaa' 
zero based indexing in lists. also negative indexing for accessing elements in the reverse order from the back... l[-1]=c
slicing.... returns a sublist... [start index inclusive : end index exclusive] 
changing an element is easy.. l[0]=x  ... also l[0:2]=[x,y]
+ simply adds two lists 
del(l[1]) deletes element at index 1
y=x where x and y are lists copies reference , so changes made to y are reflected in x.
to avoid this, use y=x[:] or y=list(x)
The ; sign is used to place commands on the same line
round() and max() functions... help(function_name) gives the documentation of the function
len() is used to find length of string and no. of elements in a list
sorted() can be used to sort a list
methods are functions that belong to python objects
packages are directories of python scripts(modules)
import <package> .... e.g. math package
has functions accessed as math.pi and math.radians(<angle in degree>)
from numpy<package> import array<function> ... now no need to use the dot operator
